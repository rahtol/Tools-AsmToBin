Context: TGMT project. 

A tool to generate a binary image from simple ASM sourcefiles containing DB, DW and DD data directives. 
Intended to generate configuration data files, e.g. for ConfData_SDT or ConfData_System, may CDI in the future.

Uses JavaCC which I wanted to learn as a side-effect. My first project using JavaCC.
